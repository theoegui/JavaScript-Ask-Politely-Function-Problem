# JavaScript-Ask-Politely-Function-Problem
This word problem is gonna deal with nested if statements 
Create the function askPolitely that accepts a sentence as an argument. If the last character of the sentence is a question mark, then make sure the question ends with the word "please?".

If a question is already polite (meaning it already ends with "please") or the sentence is not a question, â€‹then return the inputted string without modification.



Given EXAMPLES:
- INPUT: askPolitely("May I borrow your pencil?");
- OUTPUT: "May I borrow your pencil please?"


- INPUT: askPolitely("May I ask a question please?");
- OUTPUT: "May I ask a question please?"


- INPUT: askPolitely("My name is Grace Hopper.");
- OUTPUT: "My name is Grace Hopper.";

Solutions:

function askPolitely(sentence){
	if(sentence.slice(-1) === "?"){
		if(sentence.slice(-7) === "please?"){
			return sentence;
			} else {
				return sentence.slice(0,-1) + " please?";	
			}
	} else {
		return sentence;
	}
}
